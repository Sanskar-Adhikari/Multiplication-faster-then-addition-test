# Test code for integers and floating points arithmentics( + and *)
Are integers really more efficient than floats? 
This code records time for addtion and multiplication of integers and floats using chrono library in c++. Compile it for debug for more accurate result. Releasing for "release" could bring in compiler's attemp to make it efficient and can act differently then intended. This code also does not measure overhead for loop to execute and variables to be accesed. However, this overhead is managed while calculating final time difference as the overhead is equal for both arithmetic expressions containing loops.
